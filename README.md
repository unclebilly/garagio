Garagio
===========================

This project is a web interface to open and close a garage door. 

I am using a [WiFly RN-XV](http://www.rovingnetworks.com/products/RN171XV) 
with a wire antenna for WiFi connectivity.  I followed [a 
tutorial for a DIY garage door opener](http://www.dinnovative.com/?p=163), but 
ended up doing things a tad bit differently - I used a transistor to handle the switching load for the 
relay (instead of switching it directly from the WiFly).  

Here is a screenshot of the garage door app, running on an Android phone. The user 
is expected to enter the code into the text field and then tap the garage
door opener icon.
